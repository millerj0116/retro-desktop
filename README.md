# Retro 98-style Desktop App

Using React, this project aims to "emulate" the classic Windows 98 desktop to use as a portfolio! It uses a VERY basic PHP API that hits a MySql Database, then retrieves the rest of the Project data from my existing WordPress REST API (https://millerweb.dev).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
