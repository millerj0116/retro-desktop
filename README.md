# Retro 98-style Desktop App

Using React, this project aims to "emulate" the classic Windows 98 desktop to use as a portfolio! It uses a VERY basic PHP API that hits a MySql Database, then retrieves the rest of the Project data from my existing WordPress REST API (https://millerweb.dev).


### To-dos and Improvements
- Finish the Console app
  - The console has "basic" functionality but still lacks the entire directory structure and some additional commands
- Implement "DOM" instead of using an iFrame
  - Currently the DOM game uses an iFrame just for dev purposes. I'd like to get that rebuild in react and within the full application itself
- Create a solitaire game
  - You can't have a Windows 98 experience without solitaire. I am currently in the process of programming that out
